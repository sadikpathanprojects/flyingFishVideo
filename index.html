        <h2>Flying Fish App created using Android Studio.</h2>
        
<xmp>
    This is the android game that i have created on android studio.
    basically it consists of the 3 activities
    1.splash activity:
    which remains on the screen for 7 seconds due to the multithreading 
    concept that i have applied in that activity.
    
    2.main activity
     game starts here.the constructor defined in the fishview class in the
     project will apply when the main acrivity starts.
     I have also used a random function so that all the balls will come from 
     random direction.you have the fish and you have to score as more as 
     possible.just avoid red balls because that destroys fish.
    
     If the fish hits the red ball three times,the 3rd activity appears.
     This activity will show the score that the user have earned.and it also
     has the button of start game that will redirect to the second activity
     that is main activity.
